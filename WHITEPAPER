                                                        WHITE PAPER

Falcon (FX10) represents the fusion between functional cryptocurrency and fun: a meme coin with a purpose.

Philosophy
Crypto currency is nothing less than a human invention to end wars, stop suffering and launch us into the stars.
It will allow us to build metaverses, invent new economies and finance our interstellar ambitions.
FX10 will be a kind of community centric platform for investing in connections that drive innovation and invention.
By bridging the gaps between countries and people the promise inherent in our DNA will be unleashed; manifested in novel and exciting opportunities.
By nodifying everyone and everything we will unlock the power and energy that courses through us and channel it into unbelievable projects, such as superconductive neuromorphic computing and optoelectronic intelligence devices that collectively push us forward and that  open the doors to International Moon bases, colonies on Mars and more.
But this phase in human evolution cannot be reached without lifting our brothers and sisters up.
Therefore, philanthropy will always be a core tenet of the Falcon mission.
In no particular order our tokenomics will accomplish:
- Feeding the hungry in coordination with the world's leading food charities: Action Against 	Hunger and Bread for the World Institute.
	2% of each transaction will go into a wallet for each organization
- Regular space tours for our hodlers
	2% of each transaction will go into a fund that pays for our holder's space tourism via 
	Space X, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic.
	At regular intervals a lottery will be held, with odds based on the amount you hold
- Smart Economics and to the moon ROI: 7% of each sale transaction will be converted to BTC, Eth, Doge (Binance Pegged Version) and paid as a dividend... whose collective ROI is 7,800,560,001% (7,700,000,000 %  + 998892% + 306709%); that's right 7.8 billion ROI since the launch of BitCoin.
- Liquidity: 3% of each transaction will be put into liquidity.
- Scientific Technological Advancement - 1% of each transaction will go into a fund that will be split by numerous scientific endeavors: NIST ( https://www.nist.gov/), Event Horizon Telescope (https://eventhorizontelescope.org/latest) and  providing college scholarships.
HOW TO JUSTIFY THE BONUS
For each transaction you get an Quantititave Success Payment
Quantitative Success - Measurements or metrics can be performed in many ways; for example the size of a glass of water can be either it's volume or weight or caloric density. This means that there is not one way to interpret the size; the same can be said for measuring anything.
For Falcon's purposes, we highly value the number of sale transactions. Each transaction represents an objective growth and therefore we interpret it as an increase in value.
Therefore a dividend is issued to hodlers based on this increase in value.
The Transaction fee

The Logic
Competing central banks that vie for control, power and influence are a foundational component of world wars. If you decrease their power and minimze their effect you cannot get world wars; by subtracting one of their main points of leverage you preclude violent international conflict. The decentralization of Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. returns the nation state's control to the people. Once the people collectively control the units of exchange in global markets, the world's currencies (which will mainly be digital going forward), the nation states will have to partner with the people to raise armies. The days of conscription will permanently end and because international war is always a worse possibility than international peace, with the democratization of raising armies will mark the end of world war.

And regardless of how much wealth individual citizens posess it is illegal and impossible ...
